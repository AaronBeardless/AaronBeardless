##  <b> Hello there, I am Aaron Kerker - aka Aaron Beardless </b> :wave:


### 📖 About me
My Name is Aaron Kerker, I am a 14 year old, self thaught, hobbyist "game developer".
I started my game-dev journey using unity when I was 7 years old. 
Over the years I have been using different engines and programming languages to better my skills.
\
Most Recently I wanted to learn how to make the software  that powered my journey so far, GAME ENGINES.

### 💻 What am I currently working on?
I am currently working on my 3rd game engine titled "MAKESHIFT", which I think describes it quite well.
As well as that I am working on a custom Entity Component System titled "MinTY" to be used within the engine.

### 👨‍💻 My languages and tools
